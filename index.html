                    <li>We start off by setting our feet shoulder width apart inside the trapbar, and lean forward with your upper body until you reach the handles.</li>
                    <li>Grab the handles and try to push your chest upwards towards the ceiling and simultaneously lower your hips until your shins are no longer vertically aligned.</li>
                    <li>Stand up by pushing your hips forward until you’re standing upright.</li>
                </ol></div>
                <p>Tip: Keep your chin down, think of it like you're supposed to have a double chin during the whole exercise.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Place the bar on safely on your neck, the most common place to rest the bar is just below th C7 vertebrae. Your feet should be approximately shoulder width apart.</li>
                        <li>After you've found a good position start the movement by gentle and slowly pushing your hips backwards and downwards, while also keeping your knees from caving inwards.</li>
                        <li>Keep going downwards as long as you can keep a neutral/straight upper body.</li>
                        <li>When at your lowest position, turn the movement and pushing upward until you reach your starting position.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>Tip: Before starting every new repetition, fill your lungs with as much air as possible creating a ballon function around your core. This techniques ensures a safer but also a stronger stance at the lowest point.</p>
